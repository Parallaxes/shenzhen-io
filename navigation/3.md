# Part 3: Security Camera (Fake) - Assignment #1

![Security Camera (Fake) - Assignment #1 Email]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/images/p3/p3-1.png)

Here's what we're started with:
![Security Camera (Fake) - Assign #1 Seed]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/images/p3/p3-2.png)

We can start by dragging an MC4000 to the bottom board, and writing some code.
![Security Camera (Fake) - Assign #1 Code 1]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/images/p3/p3-3.png)

Ok, so what does that do exactly? Let's break it down.

```assembly
mov 0 p0   # Move the value 0 to port p0
slp 4      # Sleep for 4 cycles
mov 100 p0 # Move the value 100 to port p0
slp 2      # Sleep for 2 cycles
mov 0 p0   # Move the value 0 to port p0
slp 1      # Sleep for 1 cycle
mov 100 p0 # Move the value 100 to port p0
slp 1      # Sleep for 1 cycle
```

Basically, what we're doing:
1. Set p0 to 0, then wait 4 cycles.
2. Set p0 to 100, then wait 2 cycles.
3. Set p0 to 0, wait 1 cycle.
4. Set p0 to 100, wait 1 cycle.
5. Broadcast repeat!!


Annnd, that should about do it.
