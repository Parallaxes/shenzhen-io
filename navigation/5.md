# Part 5: Replacement Factory Module - Assignment #2

![Part 5: Replacement Factory Module - Email]({{ "/assets/images/p5/p5-1.png" | relative_url }})

Boom!

Anyhow, here's what we've got.

![Part 5: Replacement Factory Module - Seed]({{ "/assets/images/p5/p5-2.png" | relative_url }})

![Part 5: Replacement Factory Module - Task]({{ "/assets/images/p5/p5-3.png" | relative_url }})

![Part 5: Replacement Factory Module - Test]({{ "/assets/images/p5/p5-4.png" | relative_url }})

All we've got to do is read `control-in` and output that value multipled by 2 to `control-out`. Easy enough.

Here's the code I wrote:

![Part 5: Replacement Factory Module - Board]({{ "/assets/images/p5/p5-5.png" | relative_url }})

What we're doing here is pretty simple:

```assembly
mov p0 acc  # Read p0 (input) into acc
mul 2       # Multiply the value in memory (acc) by 2
mov acc p1  # Move acc to p1 (output)
slp 1       # Sleep
```

Lo and behold, success! (With the most efficient design)

![Part 5: Replacement Factory Module - Success]({{ "/assets/images/p5/p5-6.png" | relative_url }})
