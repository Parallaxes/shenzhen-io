# Part 8: Diagnostic Pulse Generator - Assignment #3

![Part 8: Diagnostic Pulse Generator - Email]({{ "/assets/images/p8/p8-1.png" | relative_url }})

Hrm, a pulse generator you say? With custom boards and conditional execution oh goodie. Time to pull out the good old reference manual **which is located in the game files**. 
I have uploaded this to the repo for your convenience, and it is located here: [SHENZHEN-IO Manual](https://github.com/Parallaxes/shenzhen-io/assets/misc/SHENZHEN-IO_Manual.pdf)

Ok, let's go.

Here's what we're working with:

![Part 8: Diagnostic Pulse Generator - Seed]({{ "/assets/images/p8/p8-2.png" | relative_url }})

We have a board with two ports: `button` and `pulse`. 

![Part 8: Diagnostic Pulse Generator - Task]({{ "/assets/images/p8/p8-3.png" | relative_url }})

From this, we know that `button` is a simple input and `pulse` is a simple output, and `button` stimulations generate pulses until the button is released. Cool.

The problem statement is pretty simple, but it requires a bit of manual reading. So, let's whip it out.

Here's the little section describing conditional execution:

***

> **Conditional Execution**

All instructions in the MCxxxx programming language are capable of conditional execution. Prefixing an in
struction with a “+” or “-” symbol will cause that instruction to be enabled or disabled by test instructions. When an 
instruction is disabled by a test instruction, it will be skipped and will not consume power. Instructions with no prefix 
are never disabled and always execute normally. All conditional instructions start in a disabled state. A test instruction 
must be executed to enable conditional instructions. 

*For an example of conditional instructions in use, see **Application Note 650: Touch-Activated Light Controller.***

We'll also need to understand comparison operators:

***

**teq** R/I R/I

Test if the value of the first operand (A) is equal to the value of the second operand (B)

| **Condition**       | **Effect on '+' Instructions** | **Effect on '-' Instructions** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| A is equal to B     | Enabled                        | _Disabled_                     |
| A is not equal to B | _Disabled_                     | Enabled                        |

***

Ok, now let's get coding. Here's the design I came up with:

![Part 8: Diagnostic Pulse Generator - Board]({{ "/assets/images/p8/p8-5.png" | relative_url }})

So, what's happening here?

```assembly
# Compare p0 to 100; if they are equal, 
# execute the lines with the '+' in front of them.
# If not, jump the '+' section and run slp 1 
teq p0 100      
+ mov 100 p1    # Move 100 into p1 (output)
+ slp 1         # Sleep for 1 interval
+ mov 0 p1      # Move 0 into p1 (output), achieving the pulse
slp 1           # Sleep if no stimulus
```

It may be noted, however, that you cannot put a '-' on the last `slp 1` line, because that would completely _disable_ that line when running the condiional.

Yippee!
